 * Problem You are given an array containing N distinct integers. You perform
 * the following operations on this array:
 * 
 * For each pair of integers, you find the absolute difference D between those
 * integers and insert D into the array (if it was not already present in the
 * array). You repeat task 1 until the array becomes constant. This implies that
 * the absolute difference between any two elements in the array is also an
 * element present in the array. Write a program to find the Kth largest element
 * of the array after all the operations have been performed. If there is no
 * such element, print -1.
 * 
 * Input format
 * 
 * First line: T (Number of test cases) First line in each test case: N Second
 * line in each test case: N space-separated integer (denoting the elements of
 * the array) Third line in each test case: K
 * 
 * Output format
 * 
 * For each test case, print the Kth largest element of the array. If there is
 * no such element print -1.
